				My name is Benjamin Leon, I was born in Los Angeles on March 27, 1981. I am the 2nd of two boys born to Rosa and Jose Leon. I live in the City of Bell where I have lived for most of my life. I also work in the City of Bell. I work for the Los Angeles Unified School District at Nueva Vista Elementary where I work as an IT Support Technician. I have worked for LAUSD since the year 2000. 

				My interest in the tech field started in high school where I was enrolled in the Tech Academy at Elizabeth Learning Center. There I learned basic HTML and computer repair. The skills I learned in high school helped me land a Teacher Assistant (TA) job in the year 2000. As a TA I was in charge of a computer lab where I taught children computer and word processing skills. While a TA I was also enrolled at California State University Los Angeles where I studied Business Administration with an Option in Finance. In 2010 I graduated from CSULA with a BS in Business Administration. Although I learned many useful skills and enjoyed learning about the business world my passion has always been in the tech field. In 2014 I enrolled in a computer repair class at ABC Adult School to further my computer skills and In 2015 I was hired by LAUSD as an IT Support Technician.

				I have always had a natural curiosity about how things work wether it be a machine, the stock market or a computer program so it is no surprise that coding has drawn my attention. My interest in coding began in high school where I was taught basic HTML to build websites. I furthered my interest in programming during the days of MySpace were I would spend hours customizing my page by copying code from my favorite websites. To build on my coding skills in 2018 I enrolled in UCLA Extension’s Coding Bootcamp where I hope to become a full stack developer.
